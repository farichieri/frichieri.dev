title: My plans for 2024

Last year, I've been working on my SaaS [Nutrition Plans](https://nutritionplans.co). I didn't make money with it, but I learned a lot about how to build a SaaS from scratch and improved my developer skills highly. I also improved myself as a person and as a worker. One thing for sure is that you need to pay attention to the marketing first and don't spend too much time on building many features, but rather focus on developing only the essential features to initiate sales and attract traffic.

Since I wasn't making money, I started applying for jobs and having interviews. I accepted a position as a Shopify Developer at [tidalrise.uk](https://www.tidalrise.uk/). I'm going to start working on it next week.

I also started working as a freelancer in [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/frichieri) since last month. I found it fascinating. I could quickly start earning money and receiving positive reviews to keep improving and getting more clients.

#### My objetives for this year are:

- Working as a Shopify Developer at Tidal Rise. If my experience is good and the salary satisfies my professional expectations, I will keep working there for the next years.
- I will keep working as a freelancer and get more clients, I have time to do both things and I want to keep improving my skills and earning more money.
- Utilizing my free time, not dedicated to Tidal Rise or freelance projects, to further develop Nutrition Plans. I want to keep improving it and start getting traffic. Now I'm not in a hurry to make it profitable, but I want to keep working on it for the future. Once I see it has potential, I will start investing more time and money (marketing) on it.
- Speaking of health, I've been training regulary all 2023, and eating healthy too, of course, using my own APP. I will keep on it, it's an habit, and as an habit, it is harder to stop doing it than to keep doing it.
- The last thing I will evaluate is the possibility of becoming a digital nomad. I'm not yet sure whether it will happen by the end of this year or in 2025, but I want to have that experience in my youth (at least a few months).

I'm very possitive for this year, let's see how it goes üòÅ
