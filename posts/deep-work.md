I've read a very good book recently and I wanted to share the ideas that I liked the most.

This book is called Deep Work and defines the benefits of going deep when working to achieve maximum results in a shorter time.

# **Intro**

**_What is Deep Work?_** Deep Work is when activities are performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

**_What is Shallow Work?_** Shallow Work are noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you permanently reduce your capacity to perform deep work.

On the other side, network tools are distracting us from work that requires unbroken concentration, while simultaneously degrading our capacity to remain focused.

Our work culture's shift toward the shallow is exposing a massive economic and personal opportunity for the few that recognize the potential of resisting the trend and prioritizing depth. As a result, deep work is a skill that has great value today.

### **_And why Deep Work is valuable?_**

1. You must master the art of quickly learning complicated things. This task requires deep work. If you don't cultivate this ability, you're likely to fall behind as technology advances.
2. The impacts of the digital network revolution cut both ways. If you can create something useful, its reachable audience is essentially limitless-- which greatly magnifies your reward. On the other hand, if you're producing is mediocre, then you're in trouble, as it's too easy for you audience to find a better alternative online. To succeed you have to produce the absolute best stuff you're capable of producing--a task that requires depth.

The real rewards are reserved not for those who are comfortable using Facebook (a shallow task, easily replicated), but instead for those who are comfortable building the innovative distributed systems that run the service (a decidely deep task, hard to replicate). Deep work is so important that we might consider it, "the superpower of the 21st century"

The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their coworking life, will thrive.

Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output.

"To cultivate an ability to produce real value in an increasing distracted world; and to recognize a truth embraced by the most productive and important personalities of generations past: A deep life is a good life."
