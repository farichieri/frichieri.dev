I've read a very good book recently and I wanted to share the ideas that I liked the most.

This book is called Deep Work, written by Cal Newport and defines the benefits of working deeply in order to achieve maximum results in a shorter period of time.

The book uis divided in two parts

- The Idea. (3 Chapters: 1. Deep Work is Valuable; 2. Deep Work is Rare; 3. Deep Work is Meaningful)
- The Rules. (4 rules: 1. Work Deeply; 2. Embrace Boredom; 3. Quit Social Media; 4. Drain the Shallows)

# **Intro**

**_What is Deep Work?_** Deep Work is when activities are performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

**_What is Shallow Work?_** Shallow Work are noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you permanently reduce your capacity to perform deep work.

On the other side, network tools are distracting us from work that requires unbroken concentration, while simultaneously degrading our capacity to remain focused.

Our work culture's shift toward the shallow is exposing a massive economic and personal opportunity for the few that recognize the potential of resisting the trend and prioritizing depth. As a result, deep work is a skill that has great value today.

### **_And why Deep Work is valuable?_**

- You must master the art of quickly learning complicated things. This task requires deep work. If you don't cultivate this ability, you're likely to fall behind as technology advances.
- The impacts of the digital network revolution cut both ways. If you can create something useful, its reachable audience is essentially limitless-- which greatly magnifies your reward. On the other hand, if you're producing is mediocre, then you're in trouble, as it's too easy for you audience to find a better alternative online. To succeed you have to produce the absolute best stuff you're capable of producing--a task that requires depth.

The real rewards are reserved not for those who are comfortable using Facebook (a shallow task, easily replicated), but instead for those who are comfortable building the innovative distributed systems that run the service (a decidely deep task, hard to replicate). Deep work is so important that we might consider it, "the superpower of the 21st century"

The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their coworking life, will thrive.

Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output.

# Chapter One: Deep Work is Valuable

---

In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: Those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital.

### How to become a winner in the New Economy:

### Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy:

- The ability to quickly master hard things.
- The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.

If you can't learn, you can't thrive.
You must then transform that latent potential into tangible results that people value.
If you can't produce, you won't thrive--no matter how skilled or talented you are.

**The two core abilities just described depend on your ability to perform deep work.**

Deep Work helps you quickly learn things: because to learn requiers intense concentration.

### What deliberate practice actually requires:

- Your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you're trying to improve or an idea you're trying to master.
- You receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it's most productive.

Deliberate practice cannot exist alongisde distraction, and it instead requires uninterrupted concentration.

By focusing intensely on a specific skill, you're forcing the specific relevant circuit to fire, again and again, in isolation.
The reason why it's important to focus intensely on the task at hand while avoiding distraction is because this is the only way to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination.

By contrast, if you're trying to learn a complex new skill (say, SQL database management) in a state of low concentration (perhaps you also have your Facebook feed open), you're firing too many circuits simultaneously and haphazardhly to isolate the group of neurons you actually want to strenghten

To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction. To learn, in other words, is an act of deep work. If you're comfortable going deep, you'll be comfortable mastering the increasingly complex systems and skills needed to thrive in our economy. If you instead remain one of the many for whom depth is uncomfortable and distraction ubiquitous, you shouldn't expect these systems and skills to come easily to you.

### High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) \* (Intensity of Focus)

### Attention Residue:

- When you switch from some Task A to another Task B, your attention doesn't immediately follow--a residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task. This residue gets especially thick if your work on Task A was unbounded and of low intensity before you switched, but even if you finish Task A before moving on, your attention remains divided for a while.
- People experiencing attention residue after switching tasks are likely to demostrate poor performance on that next task, and the more intense the residue, the worse the performance.

By working on a single task for a long time without switching, you can minimize the negative impact of attention residue from other obligations, allowing you to maximize performance on this one task.

The common habit of working in a state of semi-distraction is potentially devastating to your performance. The attention residue left by unresolved switches dampens your performance (checking email, social media, etc.)

To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction.

# Chapter Two: Deep Work Is Rare

An interruption, even if short, delays the total time required to complete a task by a significant fraction.

The myopiaof your peers and employers uncovers a great personal advantage. Assuming the trends outlined here continue, depth will become increasingly rare and therefore increasingly valuable.

# Chapter Three: Deep Work Is Meaningful

What we choose to focus on and what we choose to ignore--plays in defining the quality of our life.

The skillful management of attention is the sine qua non of the good life and the key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience.

We tend to place a lot of emphasis on our circumstances, assuming that what happens to us determines how we feel. Our brains instead construct our worldview based on what we pay attention to.

Who we are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love--is the sum of what you focus on.

What you choose to focus on exerts significant leverage on your attitude going forward.

When you lose focus, your mind tends to fix on what could be wrong with your life instead of what's right.

The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limit in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile. This mental state is called Flow.

Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one's work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is instructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.

Human beings, it seems, are their best when immersed deeply in something challenging.

Deep work is an activity well suited to generate a flow state (stretching your mindd to its limits, concentrating, and losing yourself in an activity).

Any pursuit--be it physical or cognitive--that supports high levels of skill can also generate a sense of sacredness.

It follows that to embrace deep work in your own career, and to direct it toward cultivating your skill, is an effort that can transform a knowledge work job from a distracted, draining obligation into something satisfying--a portal to a world full of shining, wondrous things,

# Part 2: The Rules.

---

# Rule #1: Work Deeply

You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it. This will happen to you, regardless of your intention--unless, that is, you're smart about your habits.

The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals to your worklife designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration.

### DECIDE ON YOUR DEPTH PHILOSOPHY

You need your own philosophy for integrating deep work into your professional life.

- THE MONASTIC PHILOSOPHY OF DEEP WORK SCHEDULING:
  This Philosophy attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations. Practicioners of the monastic philosophy tend to have a well-defined and highly valued professional goal that they're pursuing, and the bulk of their professional success comes from doing this one thing exceptionally well.
  It's this clarity that helps them eliminate the thicket of shallow concerns that tend to trip up those who value proposition in the working world is more varied.
  \*You should give this philosophy serious consideration, as it might be the deciding factor between an average career and one that will be remembered.

- THE BIMODAL PHILOSOPHY OF DEEP WORK SCHEDULING:
  This Philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else. During the deep time, the bimodal worker will act monastically--seeking intense and uninterrumpted concentration. During the shallow time, such focus is not prioritized. The division of time between deep and open can happen on multiple scales. (4 days of week deep, 3 open || opne season of the year deep, etc.)
  The bimodal philosophy believes that deep work can produce extreme productivity, but only if the subject dedicates enough time to such endeavors to reach maximum cognitive intensity--the state in which breakthroughts occur. This is why the minimum unit of time deep work in this philosophy tends to be at least one full day.
  At this time, the bimodal philosophy is tipically deployed by people who cannot succeed in the abscence of substantial commitments to non-deep pursuits.
  Those who deploy the bimodal philosophy of deep work admire the productivity of the monastics but also respect the value they receive from the shallow behaviors in their working lives.
