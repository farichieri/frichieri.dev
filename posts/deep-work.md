I read a very good book recently and I wanted to share the ideas that I liked the most.

This book is called Deep Work, was written by Cal Newport and defines the benefits of working deeply in order to achieve maximum results in a shorter period of time.

The book uis divided in two parts

- The Idea. (3 Chapters: 1. Deep Work is Valuable; 2. Deep Work is Rare; 3. Deep Work is Meaningful)
- The Rules. (4 rules: 1. Work Deeply; 2. Embrace Boredom; 3. Quit Social Media; 4. Drain the Shallows)

# **Intro**

**_What is Deep Work?_** Deep Work is when activities are performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

**_What is Shallow Work?_**
Shallow Work are noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you permanently reduce your capacity to perform deep work.

On the other side, network tools are distracting us from work that requires unbroken concentration, while simultaneously degrading our capacity to remain focused.

Our work culture's shift toward the shallow is exposing a massive economic and personal opportunity for the few that recognize the potential of resisting the trend and prioritizing depth. As a result, deep work is a skill that has great value today.

##### **And why Deep Work is valuable?**

- You must master the art of quickly learning complicated things. This task requires deep work. If you don't cultivate this ability, you're likely to fall behind as technology advances.
- The impacts of the digital network revolution cut both ways. If you can create something useful, its reachable audience is essentially limitless-- which greatly magnifies your reward. On the other hand, if you're producing is mediocre, then you're in trouble, as it's too easy for you audience to find a better alternative online. To succeed you have to produce the absolute best stuff you're capable of producing--a task that requires depth.

The real rewards are reserved not for those who are comfortable using Facebook (a shallow task, easily replicated), but instead for those who are comfortable building the innovative distributed systems that run the service (a decidely deep task, hard to replicate). Deep work is so important that we might consider it, "the superpower of the 21st century"

The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their coworking life, will thrive.

Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output.

# Chapter One: Deep Work is Valuable

---

In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: Those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital.

##### **Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy:**

- The ability to quickly master hard things.
- The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.

If you can't learn, you can't thrive.
You must then transform that latent potential into tangible results that people value.
If you can't produce, you won't thrive--no matter how skilled or talented you are.

**The two core abilities just described depend on your ability to perform deep work.**

Deep Work helps you quickly learn things: because to learn requiers intense concentration.

##### **What deliberate practice actually requires:**

- Your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you're trying to improve or an idea you're trying to master.
- You receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it's most productive.

Deliberate practice cannot exist alongisde distraction, and it instead requires uninterrupted concentration.

By focusing intensely on a specific skill, you're forcing the specific relevant circuit to fire, again and again, in isolation.
The reason why it's important to focus intensely on the task at hand while avoiding distraction is because this is the only way to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination.

By contrast, if you're trying to learn a complex new skill (say, SQL database management) in a state of low concentration (perhaps you also have your Facebook feed open), you're firing too many circuits simultaneously and haphazardhly to isolate the group of neurons you actually want to strenghten

To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction. To learn, in other words, is an act of deep work. If you're comfortable going deep, you'll be comfortable mastering the increasingly complex systems and skills needed to thrive in our economy. If you instead remain one of the many for whom depth is uncomfortable and distraction ubiquitous, you shouldn't expect these systems and skills to come easily to you.

##### **High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) \* (Intensity of Focus)**

##### **Attention Residue:**

- When you switch from some Task A to another Task B, your attention doesn't immediately follow--a residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task. This residue gets especially thick if your work on Task A was unbounded and of low intensity before you switched, but even if you finish Task A before moving on, your attention remains divided for a while.
- People experiencing attention residue after switching tasks are likely to demostrate poor performance on that next task, and the more intense the residue, the worse the performance.

By working on a single task for a long time without switching, you can minimize the negative impact of attention residue from other obligations, allowing you to maximize performance on this one task.

The common habit of working in a state of semi-distraction is potentially devastating to your performance. The attention residue left by unresolved switches dampens your performance (checking email, social media, etc.)

To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction.

# Chapter Two: Deep Work Is Rare

An interruption, even if short, delays the total time required to complete a task by a significant fraction.

The myopiaof your peers and employers uncovers a great personal advantage. Assuming the trends outlined here continue, depth will become increasingly rare and therefore increasingly valuable.

---

# Chapter Three: Deep Work Is Meaningful

What we choose to focus on and what we choose to ignore--plays in defining the quality of our life.

The skillful management of attention is the sine qua non of the good life and the key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience.

We tend to place a lot of emphasis on our circumstances, assuming that what happens to us determines how we feel. Our brains instead construct our worldview based on what we pay attention to.

Who we are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love--is the sum of what you focus on.

What you choose to focus on exerts significant leverage on your attitude going forward.

When you lose focus, your mind tends to fix on what could be wrong with your life instead of what's right.

The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limit in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile. This mental state is called Flow.

Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one's work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is instructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.

Human beings, it seems, are their best when immersed deeply in something challenging.

Deep work is an activity well suited to generate a flow state (stretching your mindd to its limits, concentrating, and losing yourself in an activity).

Any pursuit--be it physical or cognitive--that supports high levels of skill can also generate a sense of sacredness.

It follows that to embrace deep work in your own career, and to direct it toward cultivating your skill, is an effort that can transform a knowledge work job from a distracted, draining obligation into something satisfying--a portal to a world full of shining, wondrous things,

# Part 2: The Rules.

---

---

# Rule #1: Work Deeply

You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it. This will happen to you, regardless of your intention--unless, that is, you're smart about your habits.

The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals to your worklife designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration.

### **DECIDE ON YOUR DEPTH PHILOSOPHY**

You need your own philosophy for integrating deep work into your professional life.

- **THE MONASTIC PHILOSOPHY OF DEEP WORK SCHEDULING:**
  This Philosophy attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations. Practicioners of the monastic philosophy tend to have a well-defined and highly valued professional goal that they're pursuing, and the bulk of their professional success comes from doing this one thing exceptionally well.
  It's this clarity that helps them eliminate the thicket of shallow concerns that tend to trip up those who value proposition in the working world is more varied.
  \*You should give this philosophy serious consideration, as it might be the deciding factor between an average career and one that will be remembered.

- **THE BIMODAL PHILOSOPHY OF DEEP WORK SCHEDULING:**
  This Philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else. During the deep time, the bimodal worker will act monastically--seeking intense and uninterrumpted concentration. During the shallow time, such focus is not prioritized. The division of time between deep and open can happen on multiple scales. (4 days of week deep, 3 open || open season of the year deep, etc.)
  The bimodal philosophy believes that deep work can produce extreme productivity, but only if the subject dedicates enough time to such endeavors to reach maximum cognitive intensity--the state in which breakthroughts occur. This is why the minimum unit of time deep work in this philosophy tends to be at least one full day.
  At this time, the bimodal philosophy is tipically deployed by people who cannot succeed in the abscence of substantial commitments to non-deep pursuits.
  Those who deploy the bimodal philosophy of deep work admire the productivity of the monastics but also respect the value they receive from the shallow behaviors in their working lives.

- **THE RHYTMIC PHILOSOPHY OF DEEP WORK SCHEDULING:**
  This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit. The goal, in other words, is to generate a rhythm for this work that removes the need for you to invest energy in deciding if and when you're going to go deep.
  Provides an interesting contrast to the bimodal philosophy. It perhaps fails to achieve the most intense levels of deep thinking sought in the daylong concentration sessions favored by the bimodalist. The trade-off, however, is that this approach works better with the reality of human nature. By supporting deep work with rock-solid routines that make sure a little bit gets done on a regular basis, the rhytmic scheduler will often log a larger total number of deep hours per year.

##### **THE JOURNALIST PHILOSOPHY OF DEEP WORK SCHEDULING**

You fit deep work wherever you can into your schedule. This name is a nod to the fact that journalists, are trained to shift into a writing mode on a momnent's notice, as is required by the deadline-driven nature of their profession.
This ability to rapidly switch your mind from shallow to deep mode doesn't come naturally. Without practice, such switchers can seriously deplete your finite willpower reserves. This habit also requires a sense of confidence in your abilities--a conviction that what you're doing is important and will succeed.

##### **RITUALIZE**

To make the most out of your deep work session, build rituals.
1.Where you'll work and for how long. (If it's quiet, better. Also set a time frame.)
2.How you'll work once you start to work. (What will measure your work.)
3.How you'll support your work. (tea, walk between, right food to keep energy, etc.)

##### **MAKE GRAND GESTURES**

By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task. This boost in importance reduces your mind's instinct to procrastinate and delivers an injection of motivation and energy.
It's not just the change of environment or seeking of quiet that enables more depth. The dominant force is the psychology of commiting so seriously to the task at hand. To put yourself in an exotic location to focus on a writing project, or to take a week off from work just to think, or to lock yourself in a hotel room until you complete an important invention: These gestures push your deep goal to a level of mental priority that helps unlock the needed mental resources. Sometimes to go deep, you must first go big.

##### **DON'T WORK ALONE**

For many types of work--especially when pursuing innovation--colaborative deep work can yield better results

##### **EXECUTE LIKE A BUSINESS**

What trips up companies is figuring out how to execute the strategy once identified.

DISCIPLINES (Like a business):

- **FOCUS ON THE WILDLY IMPORTANT**

  Execution should be aimed at a small number of "wildly important goals". This simplicity will help you focus an organization's energy to a sufficient intensity to ignite real results.
  For an individual focused on deep work, the implication is that you should identify a small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with your deep work hours. To have a specific goal that would return tangible and substantial professional benefits will generate a steady stream of enthusiasm.

- **ACT ON THE LEAD MEASURES**

  Once you've identified a widly important goal, you need to measure your success. Lag measures and Lead measures.
  It's easy to identify the relevant lead measure: time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal.

- **KEEP A COMPELLING SCOREBOARD**

  People play differently when they're keeping score.
  When attempting to drive your team's engagement toward your organization's wildly important goal, it's important that they have a public place to record and track their lead measures. This scoreboard creates a sense of competition that drives them to focus on these measures, even when other demands vie for their attention. Hours spent working deeply should be the lead measure.

- **CREATE A CADENCE OF ACCOUNTABILITY**
  Put in place "a rhythm of regular and frequent meetings of any team that owns a wildly important goal"

### **DOWNTIME**

## **BE LAZY**

At the end of the workday, shut down your consideration of work issues until the next morning--no after dinner email check, no mental replays of conversations, and no scheming about how you'll handle an upcoming challenge; shut down work thinking completely. If you need more time, then extend your workday, but once you shut down, your mind must be left free.

**THREE POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS OF THE DOWNTIME**

- ## **DOWNTIME AIDS INSIGHTS:**

  Providing your conscious brain time to rest enables your unconscious mind to take a shift sorting through your most complex professional challenges. A shutdown habit, therefore, is not necessarily reducing the amount of time you're engaged in productive work, but is instead diversifying the type of work you deploy.

- ## **DOWNTIME HELPS RECHARGE THE ENERGY NEEDED TO WORK DEEPLY:**

  Spending time in nature can improve your ability to concentrate.
  \*Directed attention: This resource is finite, if you exhaust it, you'll struggle to concentrate.
  ()Having a casual conversation with a friend, listening to music while making dinner, playing a game with your kids, going for a run--the types of activities that will fill your time in the evening if you enforce a work shutdown--play the same attention-restoring roles as walking in nature.
  ()On the other hand, if you keep interrupting your evening to check and respond to email, or put aside a few hours after dinner to catch up on an approaching deadline, you're robbing your directed attention centers of the uninterrupted rest they need for restoration.
  ()Only the confidence that you're done with work until the next day can convince your brain to downshift to the level where it can begin to recharge for the next day to follow.
  Trying to squeeze a little more work out of your evenings might reduce your effectiveness the next day enough that you end up getting less done than if you had instead respected a shutdown.

- ## **THE WORK THAT EVENING DOWNTIME REPLACES IS USUALLY NOT THAT IMPORTANT:**
  Your capacity for deep work in a given day is limited. If you're careful about your schedule, you should hit your daily deep work capacity during your workday. It follows, therefore, that by evening, you're beyond the point where you can continue to effectively work deeply. Any work you do fit into the night, therefore won't be the type of high-value activities that really advance your career; your efforts will instead likely be confined to low-value shallow tasks (executed at a slow, low-energy pace). By deferring evening work, in other words, you're not missing out on much of importance.

To succeed with this strategy, you must first accept the commitment that once your workday shuts down, you cannot allow even the smallest incursion of professional concerns into your field of attention (checking-email, browsing work-related websites, etc.) Even a brief intrussion of work can generate a self-reinforcing stream of distraction that impedes the shutdown advantages.
Another key commitment for succeeding is to ensure that every incomplete task has been reviewed and that for each you have a plan you trust for its completion, or it's captured to be revised when the time is right (like moving the task to another day)

The idea that you can ever reach a point where all your obligations are handled is a fantasy.

Regulary resting your brain improves the quality of your deep work. When you work, work hard. When you're done, be done. Your average email response time might suffer some, but you'll more than make up for this with the sheer volume of truly important work produced during the day by your refreshed ability to dive deeper than you exhausted peers.

# Rule #2: Embrace Boredom

**The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained.**

Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don't simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction.

You'll struggle to achieve the deepest levels of concentration if you spend the rest of your time fleeing the slightest hint of boredom.

Constant attention switching online has a lasting negative effect on your brain.

People who multitask all the time can't filter out irrelevancy. They can't manage a working memory. They are chronical distracted. They initiate much larger parts of their brain that are irrelevant to the task at hand... they are pretty much mental wrecks.

Once your brain has become accustomed to on-demand distraction, it's hard to shake the addiction even when you want to concentrate.

**Don't take break from distraction. Instead, take breaks from focus.**
Suggestion: Internet Sabbath (Take 1 day off from internet) or schedule the breaks to distraction.
Do what Thoreau did, which is learn to have a little disconnectedness within the connected world--don't run away.

It's the constant switching from low-stimuli/high-value activities to high-stimuli/low-value activities, at the slightest hint of boredom or cognitive challenge, that teaches your mind to never tolerate an absence of novely. This constant switching can be understood analously as weakening the mental muscles ersponsible for organizing the many sources vying for your attention.

When in an offline block, put your phone away, ignore texts, and refrain from Internet usage.

**To succeed in deep work you must rewier your brain to be comfortable resisting distraction stimuli. This doesnt't mean that you have to eliminate distraction behaviors; it's sufficient that you instead eliminate the ability of such behaviors to hijack your attention.**

Meditate Productively: take a period in which you're occupied phsically but not mentally--walking, jogging, driving, showering--and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem. As in mindfulness meditation, you must continue to bring your attention back to the problem at hand when it wanders or stalls. It strenghten your distraction-resisting muscles.

# Rule #3: Quit Social Media

**The first point is that we increasingly recognize that theese tools fragmented our time and reduce our ability to concentrate.**

**Willpower is limited**, and therefore the more aenticing tools you have pulling at your attention, the harder it'll be to mantain focus on something important. To master the art of deep work, therefore, you must take back control of your time and attention from the many diversions that attempt to steal them.

You are justified in using a network tool if you can identify any possible benefit to its use, or anything you might possible miss out on if you don't use it.

**These services are engineered to be addictive--robbing time and attention** from activities that more directly support your professional and personal goals (such as deep work). Eventually, if you use these tools enough, you'll arrive at the state of burned-out, hyperdistracted connectivity.

Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweight its negative impacts.

All activities, regardless of their importance, consume your same limited store of time and attention. If you service low-impact activities, therefore, you're taking away time you should be spending on higher impact activities. It's a zero-zum game. And because your time returns substantially more rewards when invested in high-impact activities than when invested in low-impact activities, the more of it you shift to the latter, the lower your overall benefit.

Part of what makes social media insidious is that the companies that profit your attention have succeeded with a masterful marketing coup: convincing our culture that if you don't use their products you might miss out.

You "like" my status update and I'll "like" yours. This agreement gives everyone simulacrum of importance without requiring much effort in return.

No one outside your closest friend and family will likely even notice you've signed off.

These services aren't necessarily, as advertised, the lifeblood of our modern connected world. They're just products, developed by private companies, funded lavishly, marketed carefully, and designed ultimately to capture then sell your personal information and attention to advertisers. They can be fun, but the scheme of your life and what you want to accomplish, they're lightweight whimsy, one unimportant distraction among many threatening to derail you from something deeper.

**Addictive websites thrive in a vacuum.** If you haven't given yourself something to do in a given moment, they'll always beckon as an appealing option. If you instead fill this free time with something of more quality, their grip on your attention will loosen.

It's crucial, therefore, that you **figure out in advance what you're going to do with your evenings and weekends before they begin.** Structured hobbies provide good fodder for those hours, as they generate specific actions with specific goals to fill your time.

"As a result, my smartphone and computer, and the distractions they can offer, typically remain neglected between the end of the workday and the next morning."

"If you give your mind something meaningful to do throughout all your waking hours, you'll end the day more fulfilled, and begin the next one more relaxed, than if you instead allow your mind to bathe for hours in semiconscious and unstructured Web surfing."

# Rule #4: Drain the Shallows

## **Schedule Every Minute of Your Day.**

Divide the hours of your workday into blocks and assign activities to the blocks.

As you go through your day, use this schedule to guide you.

## **Finish Your Work By Five Thirty**

I call this commitment fixedscheduled productivity
-By ruthlessly reducing the shallow while preserving the deep, this strategy frees up our time without diminishing the amount of new value we generate. Indeed, I would go so far as to argue that the reduction in shallow frees up
more energy for the deep alternative, allowing us to produce more than if we had defaulted to a more typical crowded schedule. Second, the limits to our time necessitate more careful thinking about our organizational habits, also leading to more value produced as compared to longer but less organized schedules.

## **Become Hard to Reach (by Email)**

Tip #1: Make People Who Send You E-mail Do More Work.

Tip #2: Do More Work When You Send or Reply to E-Mails.

Tip #3: Don't respond.

# Conclusion

"Gates worked with such intensity for such lengths during this two-month stretch that he would often collapse into sleep on his keyboard in the middle of writing a line of code. He would then sleep for an hour or two, wake up, and pick up right where he left off."

"The one trait that differenciated was focus."

"Deep work is important, in other words, not because distraction is evil, but because it enabled Bill Gates to start a billion-dollar industry in less than a semester."
