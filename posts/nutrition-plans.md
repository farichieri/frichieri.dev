As I said in my last post, I was looking for creating a business with a SAAS website, I decided to start with a self management of tasks website: [improveme](https://improveme.vercel.app/). The idea was to create content of everything related to day planning, goals achievements, etc. Inside the app (once signed up) you get access to a day and weekly planner (which I use every day).

But then I decided to just use improveme for myself and I started a new project: [www.nutritionplans.co](www.nutritionplans.co). It's a meal planner platform, where you will be able to select a meal plan (Balanced, Vegetarian, Mediterranean, etc), adapt it with your body features and goals, and meals settings, and then get a personalized diet with all the nutrients that you need to achieve your goal.

I'll keep working hard in Nutrition Plans. I'm planning to ship for the end of this month. And I will keep giving it all to make it something big.
