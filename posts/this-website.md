I built **This website** with the objetive of showing my work to everyone interested, and because I want to register my growing path as a developer.
It was developed with Next.js a framework of React that I love (just check how fast the pages load) and mdn for the posts.

### And why a blog?

I saw many top developers doing this, so I decided to try it. I think it's a great idea,

- first, because I can learn a lot of myself,
- second, because I can get feedback from other people,
- and third, because these posts could be of help for other people in the future.
- And also, as a side effect, I will improve my writing english skills (please [let me know](https://frichieri.dev/contact) if you see any mistake).

### My plants for this year:

This year I will focus full time in developing a business. A website that solves a necessity, serves many people and gets a revenue from it.

I've always wanted to build a sucessfuly business. I tried and failed. I think that I wasn't prepared. Rarely one person can build a successful business at the first time.

Now I think it's time. I will write about it soon.

Best  
Fabricio
