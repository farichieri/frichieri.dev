I created **this website** with the goal of showing my work to anyone interested, and because I want to register my growing journey as a developer.
It was developed using Next.js, a React framework that I really appreciate (check out how fast the pages load) and mdn for the posts.

### And why a blog?

I saw a lot of top developers doing it, so I decided to give it a try. I think it's a great idea,

- first, because I can learn a lot about myself,
- second, because I can get feedback from other people,
- and third, because these contributions might help other people in the future.
- And as a side effect, I will also improve my English skills (please [let me know](https://frichieri.dev/contact) if you see any mistake).

### My plans for this year:

This year I'll focus entirely on developing a business. A website that solves a need and serves many people, generating an income.

I've always wanted to build a successful business. I tried and failed. I don't think I was prepared for it. It's rare that a person can build a successful business on the first try.

Now I think it's time. I'll write about it soon.

Best  
Fabricio
